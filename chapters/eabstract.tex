In recent years, WebAssembly (Wasm)has garnered significant attention as a runtime environment for cloud applications due to its OS and hardware architecture neutrality, as well as its safety features. Various types of Wasm runtimes have emerged, ranging from the ultra-lightweight WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR) to feature-rich options like WasmEdge, designed for cloud-native applications. Each of these runtimes possesses unique characteristics. Consequently, there are scenarios in which applications running on Wasm can benefit from dynamically switching between runtimes to adapt to changing circumstances.
In this paper, I introduce a novel method for seamlessly transitioning between heterogeneous Wasm runtimes without interrupting the application's execution. To achieve this, I establish a runtime state framework based on the Wasm specification and implement a mechanism for preserving and restoring the runtime state. Any discrepancies arising from the internal structures of individual runtimes are addressed through the development of a conversion mechanism.

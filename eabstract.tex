In the realm of robot software development, the utilization of ROS has been on the rise. While the construction of robot software harnessing ROS often emphasizes cloud-based distributed robot systems, there are challenges in the flexibility of node placement. Specifically, the dynamic repositioning of nodes becomes complex due to differences in CPU architectures between the cloud and robots. Previous studies have pointed out the increase in overhead with dynamic placement mechanisms. Although approaches using mROS 2-POSIX have been proposed, their performance evaluations are mostly confined to microbenchmarks of network throughput, and the efficacy in real applications remains under-assessed. 
This study aims to compare the performance of mROS 2-POSIX with ROS 2. Based on experimental results, I demonstrate that mROS 2-POSIX can deliver the anticipated performance even in sophisticated applications.
